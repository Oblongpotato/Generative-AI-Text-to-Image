# Generative-AI-Text-to-Image
This Generative AI project uses Stable Diffusion to transform text prompts into high-quality, photorealistic images. Built in a Colab notebook, it integrates Hugging Face Diffusers and PyTorch with CUDA for GPU acceleration. Features include custom prompt support, enabling creative outputs like futuristic cityscapes in 4K resolution.

Note: This project requires a hugging face access token which can be generted on the Hugging face site.
